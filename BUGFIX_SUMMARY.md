# EdenCorrections Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. üö® **CRITICAL: Auto-Duty Bug Fixed**
**Problem**: Players were automatically set on duty when joining the server
**Root Cause**: `DutyManager.loadData()` automatically started duty timers for all players marked as on-duty in storage
**Fix**: 
- Modified `DutyManager.loadData()` to clear duty status for all online players on server startup
- Added proper duty status cleanup when players disconnect
- Players must now manually go on duty after joining
- Added `forceOffDuty()` and `clearImmobilization()` methods for proper cleanup

### 2. üîß **Event Spam Prevention**
**Problem**: Multiple `PlayerJoinEvent` handlers causing conflicts and potential spam
**Fix**:
- **Consolidated** all join handling into `PlayerListener` with proper priorities
- **Removed** duplicate `PlayerJoinEvent` handler from `GuiListener`  
- **Modified** `GuardListener` join handler to minimal guard-specific logic only
- **Added** proper delays and validation to prevent conflicts

### 3. üè¢ **CMI Jail Integration Improvements**
**Problem**: Jail system integration with CMI had command execution issues
**Fix**:
- **Enhanced** `jailWithCMI()` method with comprehensive error handling
- **Added** command validation and formatting improvements
- **Implemented** success/failure callback system with proper logging
- **Fixed** `JailManager` to work as CMI backend supplement (tracking only)
- **Prevented** double-teleportation issues
- **Added** fallback error handling for silent command failures

### 4. üìä **Duty State Management**
**Problem**: Duty status persisting incorrectly across sessions
**Fix**:
- **Added** `forceOffDuty()` method for clean duty termination on logout
- **Implemented** proper immobilization cleanup with `clearImmobilization()`
- **Enhanced** quit event handling to prevent state inconsistencies
- **Added** debug logging for duty state changes

## Files Modified

### Core Managers
- `DutyManager.java` - Fixed auto-duty bug, added cleanup methods
- `JailManager.java` - Improved CMI integration, fixed teleportation conflicts  
- `GuardItemManager.java` - Enhanced CMI jail command execution and error handling

### Event Listeners  
- `PlayerListener.java` - Consolidated join handling, added proper quit cleanup
- `GuardListener.java` - Reduced to minimal guard-specific join logic
- `GuiListener.java` - Removed duplicate join handler to prevent conflicts

## Key Improvements

### ‚úÖ **Auto-Duty Prevention**
- Players joining server will have duty status reset
- Must manually go on duty using `/duty` command
- Proper cleanup when players disconnect while on duty

### ‚úÖ **Event Consolidation** 
- Single consolidated `PlayerJoinEvent` handler in `PlayerListener`
- Proper priorities and delays to prevent conflicts
- Reduced event spam and potential race conditions

### ‚úÖ **CMI Integration Reliability**
- Robust error handling for CMI jail commands  
- Validation of jail configuration and parameters
- Success/failure tracking with detailed logging
- Proper separation between CMI teleportation and plugin tracking

### ‚úÖ **State Management**
- Clean duty status transitions
- Proper immobilization cleanup
- Debug logging for troubleshooting
- Persistent state validation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Auto-Duty Test**: Join server, verify not automatically on duty
2. **Manual Duty Test**: Use `/duty` command, verify proper immobilization countdown
3. **Jail Test**: Test handcuffs on players, verify CMI jail integration works
4. **Disconnect Test**: Go on duty, disconnect, rejoin - verify status is reset
5. **Multi-Guard Test**: Multiple guards joining simultaneously

## Configuration Notes

### Required Config Values
```yaml
messages:
  jail-broadcast: "<red>{player} has been jailed for {minutes} minutes. Reason: {reason}</red>"

jail:
  cmi-jail-name: "default"  # Must be valid CMI jail name
```

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode in config to see detailed logging:
```yaml
debug:
  enabled: true
  log-rank-detection: true
```

## Post-Fix Behavior

### Players Joining
1. Duty status automatically reset to OFF
2. Notification about off-duty time remaining (if any)
3. GUI auto-show if enabled (with proper delays)
4. No automatic duty activation

### Going On Duty
1. Must be in valid duty area/near NPC
2. 30-second immobilization countdown with broadcast
3. Proper kit assignment after countdown
4. Guard buffs activate correctly

### CMI Jail Integration
1. Handcuffs trigger proper cuffing countdown
2. CMI handles jail teleportation 
3. Plugin handles custom events, tracking, and rewards
4. Comprehensive error handling and logging

All fixes maintain backward compatibility and preserve existing functionality while resolving the critical bugs.
